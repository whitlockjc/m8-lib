          Project page Scale selector and Scale View key storage. The high
          nibble stores the key index; the low nibble stores the embedded Scale
          index. The PROJECT fixture changed this byte from 0x00 to 0xfe while
          changing the Project page Scale value. The SCALES fixture changed the
          key from C to E and changed this byte from 0x00 to 0x40. The KEY_ONLY
          fixture changed the key from C to G and changed this byte from 0x00
          to 0x70. The UI presents key and scale together, but the schema model
          has distinct values: key index, scale index, and Scale definition
          record.
